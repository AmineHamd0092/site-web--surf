    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>     This beautiful surf camp 
        which is just a 2 minute walk away from the beach is an 
        oasis of world travellers and locals alike where you will 
        feel right at home. It has two bungalows which can be shared 
        as well as a private studio. The large outdoor dining area 
        and the rooftop chill out terrace with hammocks is probably 
        where you will spend most of your time, when youâ€™re not on 
        the waves!</p>
         <p>   Our guests have access to free wifi and a library of books 
        and magazines on surfing and travels. Fresh and delicious 
        breakfast, lunch and dinners homemade with local produce 
        are included in the weekly packages.</p>
          <p>  Besides surfing, surfing and surfing, 
            you will also love the gorgeous sunsets on 
            the kilometres long beach as well as the morning 
            bird songs thanks to 
            the Sidi Boughaba Natural Reserve right 
            behind Mehdia which is on the migratory 
            route between Europe and Africa of hundreds 
            of species of birds.</p>
